Course-Projects
===============

This project is for the course COM S 641.

The goal of this project is to answer the new stack overflow posts and also propose an approach for repairing the code posted in the question by using the knowledge of existing answers to the questions. Our approach is if a new question is asked, we run the test cases and categorize it based on the test cases failed. Then, we will use the code similarity tools like Moss, to find a highly similar code for the question from our answer set.
